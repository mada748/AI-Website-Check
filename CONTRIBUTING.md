  # Ai Website Check
  this repo is a list of every website who uses (even partialy) ai in their website. 
</div>

# Contributing
you know building an entire list of websites using ai, Not easy, Ensuring who every website is correct and has the correct score, Not Easy, Doing it alone, Impossible. So it is why at the center of this repo there is <a href="CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>


# How To contribute
## Adding Websites
there is a very easy checklist for contributing
- Have a website who uses AI
- Have an honest descriptiion about why you think is ai, what is about the website and the score of AI used (at example: a blog website uses in 8 blogs ai? it is a 3/10)
- Create a Pull Request where you put in <a href="Readme.md">readme.md</a> the description and put the website on the list
- Wait for the owner or any other contributer to see (and question about the website if there is any question)
## Modifing Websites
but there is one small problem with the adding website system: 
### THE SMALL HOLES IN THE SHIP
maybe some rating wasn't correct or some description was not enough.
Well for this we have something called <p>The Modifier CheckList</p>
- Get enough data for saying who the website was not proprely reanked or the description wasn't enough
- Create an issue of <a href="Readme.md">readme.md</a> where you correct the description and/or ranking
- Wait (we will probably ask questions for this kinda of things)
  
# Tips
you know not everyone does the same thinng the same way and i wanted to jsut leave some tips for you

- Include Source Code: Most Browsers have a source code feature so that could help to see if there is an ai builder or ai leterally included in source code
- Be specific and straight: be specific and straight on why and beacuse you think the website is AI
- not be quackity: Do not raid with Update.md  :)
<p>This are only tips you do not need to follow them but just some tips..... BUT NOT THE QUACKITY ONE</p>
